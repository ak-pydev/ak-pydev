## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Machine Learning & AI**  
  I dive deep into neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and everything in between. I believe AI is the future and I'm here to shape it.

- **Full Stack Development**  
  From sleek front-end designs to robust back-end systems, I build applications that are as functional as they are cool. React, Node.js, and more are my go-to tools.
